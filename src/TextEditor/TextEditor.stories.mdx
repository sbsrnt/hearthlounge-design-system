# TextEditor

## Rich text editor allowing user to type and modify text, basically default input on steroids.

Honestly, while [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) is neat, a lot of plugins broke with recent release.
This component is not tested and will need to be replaced with something better.
Definitely need MD support.

Not to mention `componentWillMount` warnings. This stuff is actually ancient.
